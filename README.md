# Template Engine

Engine implemented from 500 Lines or Less Ned Batchelder's A Template Engine.
I wanted to get the idea of how these work then implement functionality from there.

## To Do:

Template inheritance and inclusion
Custom tags
Automatic escaping
Arguments to filters
Complex conditional logic like else and elif
Loops with more than one loop variable
Whitespace control
